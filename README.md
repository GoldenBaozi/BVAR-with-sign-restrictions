# Estimation and Inference of VAR with Bayesian methods

- [x] basic VAR, OLS Estimation
- [x] IRF, FEVD, HDC and plots
- [ ] identification via recursive and IV approach (soon...)
- [ ] inference via bootstrap (optional, not required with bayesian method)
- [ ] bayesian VAR
- [ ] identification via narrative sign restrictions (Antolín-Díaz and Rubio-Ramírez, 2018) with bayesian method, if time permits
- [ ] testing on examples (SW 2001, A and R 2018, etc.)
- [ ] R package
